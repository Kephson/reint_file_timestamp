Configuration Reference
=======================

Just install the extension and check your file downloads and the filelist in backend to see if it all works fine.

Go to "Admin tools->Settings->Extension configuration->reint_file_timestamp" to configure the following options:
  - Completely disable adding of timestamp to files in TYPO3 frontend
  - Define some file extensions comma separated for adding of timestamp in TYPO3 frontend
  - Completely disable adding of timestamp to files in TYPO3 backend
  - Define some file extensions comma separated for adding of timestamp in TYPO3 backend

If you disable adding of timestamps to files in frontend or backend the setting of special file extensions will have no effect.
